- If button clicked today goes green. use local storage and react state.
- Add your own option. Basic form when click add your own, with name and url. Name saves as id, all in local storage.
- Add rearrange option. use [drag and drop functionality](https://dndkit.com/) and store order in local storage.
- Maybe square UI layout like ny times games. Use CSS Grid to make square buttons that resize with the screen.
