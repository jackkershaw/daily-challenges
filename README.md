# daily-challenges
 Simple website built for my partner to link to all the daily challenges (like Wordle etc.)

## Changelog
- Changed the colour scheme to Wordle's based on user feedback. 

### Things i'd like to implement later (when I have the knowledge)
- media query for desktop view (atm is mobile first design, which is good but also needs to scale right for desktop)
- Learn how to use local storage to: 
    - Save button click state so page reload doesn't change it.
    -  Reset button colour when new day
    -  Button so people can add their own
- Continue testing out things in test.js file
- Add pop up to explain what it is and how to use
- Font load on Chrome
