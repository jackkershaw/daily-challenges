# daily-challenges
 Simple website built for my partner to link to all the daily challenges (like Wordle etc.)

### Things i'd like to implement later 
- Save button click state in local storage 
- Test whether button colour resets to red at end of day
- Continue testing out things in test.js file
- Add pop up to explain what it is and how to use
- Button so people can add their own (this gets stored in local storage)
- Font load on Chrome 
-
