  <h1>How To Play Daily Challenges</h1>
  <p>
    This is a website for collecting all the Wordle-adjacent daily
    challenges. After you visit each challenge, its button will turn
    green, and stay green to indicate your progress today. Resets
    everyday.

    <em>N.B.</em> This site is set in P22 Underground, a replica of the
    Transport for London Johnston font.
